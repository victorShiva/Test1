I've been hearing about React since I first started learning JavaScript, but I'll admit I took one look at it and it scared me. I saw what looked like a bunch of HTML mixed with JavaScript and thought, isn't this what we've been trying to avoid? What's the big deal with React?
Instead, I focused on just learning vanilla JavaScript and working with jQuery in a professional setting. After a few frustrated, failed attempts to get started with React, I finally started to get it, and I began to see why I might want to use React instead of vanilla JS or jQuery.
I tried to condense everything I've learned into a nice introduction to share with you, so here it is.
